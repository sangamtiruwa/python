#5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a mass in medieval units: talents (leivisk√§), pounds (naula), and lots (luoti).
# The program converts the input to full kilograms and grams and outputs the result to the user:

#One talent is 20 pounds.
#One pound is 32 lots.
#One lot is 13,3 grams.
