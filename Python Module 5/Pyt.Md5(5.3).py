'''3. Write a program that asks the user for an integer and tells if the number is a prime number. Prime numbers are number
that are only divisible by one or the number itself.
For example, 13 is a prime number as it can only be divided by 1 or 13 so that the result is an integer.
On the other hand, 21 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3 and 7.'''

num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

if num < 2:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")
else:
    is_prime = True

    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break

    if is_prime:
        print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
    else:
        print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")
