C: windowless cabin below the car deck.
If the user enters an invalid cabin class, the program outputs an error message Invalid cabin class.'''

user = input("Enter the cabin class of cruise ship, option(LUX,A,B,C): ")
if(user == 'LUX'):
    print("upper-deck cabin with a balcony.")
elif(user == 'A'):
    print("above the car deck, equipped with a window.")
elif(user == 'B'):
    print("windowless cabin above the car deck.")
elif(user == 'C'):
